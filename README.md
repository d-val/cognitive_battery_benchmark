#How to run 3 pots 1 egg simulation

## üíª Installation

#### With pip

```bash
pip install ai2thor
```

#### With conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ai2thor
```

#### With Docker

[üê≥ AI2-THOR Docker](https://github.com/allenai/ai2thor-docker) can be used, which adds the configuration for running a X server to be used by Unity 3D to render scenes.

#### Minimal Example

Once you've installed AI2-THOR, you can verify that everything is working correctly by running the following minimal example:

```python
from ai2thor.controller import Controller
controller = Controller(scene="FloorPlan10")
event = controller.step(action="RotateRight")
metadata = event.metadata
print(event, event.metadata.keys())
```
By installing ai2thor package, it should automatically download all the required packages. You can check them in 'requirements.txt'

## Running 3 Pots 1 Egg

Download our customized build from the following link [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3g2xwrcrxo8pgfn/AACjX594mT5x3Tfs-YkiC25La?dl=0)

Unzip custom-build.zip file at the 'nguyen_cognitive_battery' folder

Run `aithor_test.py`
```python
python3 aithor_test.py
```

If success, a window with size 2000x2000 will pop up. The egg will be put randomly into one pot.

## Module Structure

The structure of the 'nguyen_cognitive_battery' folder is as follows:

- aithor_test.py: core movements/instruction for the AITHOR agent to perform 3 pots 1 egg
- util.py: helper functions for agent movements
